# 🌦️ Weather App (React + Tailwind via CDN)

This is a simple Weather Forecast web application built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** via **CDN** in a single HTML file. It displays the current weather and a 5-day forecast for selected Indian cities using a weather API.

> ⚠️ Note: This project is built without using traditional React tooling like Vite or Create React App, due to time constraints and setup limitations. A modular, production-grade version will be developed soon.
